# cloud_detection_using_cv_module
A simple and efficient program has been built which is going to detect the presence of cloud cover on a scale of 0 to 100 of a region. This can play an importanat role in terms of weather prediction along with data collection and it's analysis. The output will comprise of map with marked zone and sector for area and percentage scale of every unit coming under those zone and sectors.

This code will help in data analysis for weather prediction....
